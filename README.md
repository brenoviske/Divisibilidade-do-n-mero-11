Hello Everyone.
This simple algorithym was made when I started my journey at coding , more precisely , my journey in Python.
Clean and straight , this programm allows you to know if a given integer number is divisible by the number 11 or if 
it is not.
Using basic, but powerful functions in Python , this algorithym can be very helpfull in you fisr meeting with the Python
language, or just for fun.
Thanks for been here, feel free to give me your feedback.
